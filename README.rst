Emigrant
========

These are the files associated with an upcoming blog post detailing how
to mosaic USGS 7.5m quads, add trails and points, calculate topologies,
generate routes and build a fast, tiled web map of the data using
OpenLayers 3, MapServer and MapProxy.

The files are organzed as follows:

* ``gis``: contains a few of the GIS layers I created; digitized points
  and trails from the Emigrant Wilderness Forest Service map

* ``http``: web server files

* ``mapserver``: MapServer files

* ``mapproxy``: MapProxy files

* ``tools``: Tools for converting the USGS GeoPDF files into workable
  layers.
