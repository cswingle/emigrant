These are the files associated with an upcoming blog post detailing how
to mosaic USGS 7.5m quads, add trails and points, calculate topologies
and generate routes.

Files:

* `emigrant.map`: Mapserver file for the raster and vector layes.

* `index.html`: OpenLayers 3 map display.

* `neatline_extraction.sh`: Read the GeoPDF metadata in order to produce
  a TIFF with as much of the whitespace removed as is possible.

* `neatline_utm11n.vrt`: The base VRT to use in the neatline extraction.

* `points.zip`: Zipped shapefile of the digitized points.

* `trails.zip`: Zipped shapefile of the digitized trails.

* `textmap.txt`: The names of the 7.5m USGS quads
