These are the files associated with an upcoming blog post detailing how
to mosaic USGS 7.5m quads, add trails and points, calculate topologies
and generate routes.

* ``index.html``: OpenLayers 3 map display.

* ``neatline_extraction.sh``: Read the GeoPDF metadata in order to produce
  a TIFF with as much of the whitespace removed as is possible.

* ``neatline_utm11n.vrt``: The base VRT to use in the neatline extraction.

* ``points.zip``: Zipped shapefile of the digitized points.

* ``trails.zip``: Zipped shapefile of the digitized trails.

* ``textmap.txt``: The names of the 7.5m USGS quads
